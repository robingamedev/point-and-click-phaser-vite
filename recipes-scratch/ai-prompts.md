## making an image

Create a very small, pixelated image in a stark 2-bit aesthetic, resembling Gameboy art with only monochrome red colors, and black. Imagine it as a character from a classic Gameboy adventure game. Aim for a simple, blocky design with few details, like a typical video game sprite, and respond with a image that's a ratio of 16:9.

I'm looking for a image of a old european castle. There's thunder in the sky.

It's too realistic. Can you make it with more blocky design? It has to look like it came from a classic Gameboy game. And make sure the image has a ratio of 16:9.

Thank you. Let's try a new image, this one is of a ancient interior castle. It's a wide view. The castle walls are marble. There are pillars and torches on the wall. A angel statue is visible.
